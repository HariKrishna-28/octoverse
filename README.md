### _Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, allowing individuals to connect with others and share their experiences, thoughts and opinions. With the rise of social media, there has been an increasing need for platforms that offer advanced functionalities, such as content moderation and multimedia support, while still maintaining a user-friendly interface. Octoverse is a social media web application built using modern technologies to achieve such functionalities. The system is implemented using ReactJS for the frontend, ExpressJS for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and Firebase for authentication, authorization, and storage. The system also employs Google's Perspective API to filter out posts that promote toxicity, explicit speech and profanity._
